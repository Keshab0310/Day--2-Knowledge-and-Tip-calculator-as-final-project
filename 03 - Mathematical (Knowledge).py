#Here are types of sign we can use for calculation
#1. Addition Sign (+) : It is used to add two numbers together. 
#2. Subtraction Sign (-): It is used to subtract one number from another.
#3. Multiplication Sign (*):  It is used to multiply two numbers together.
#4. Division Sign (/) : It is used to divide one number by another.
#5. Modulus Sign (%): It is used to find the remainder or signed remainder of a division.
#6. Exponentiation Sign (**): It represents exponentiation, which means multiplying a number by itself a certain number of times.

#The order of operation in mathematical operation are
#PEMDAS
#P - Parentheses / Indices ()
#E - Exponents / Indexes ^
#M - Multiplication / Indexex  *
#D - Division / Opetator /
#A - Addition / Operator  + 
#S - Subtraction / Operator -
#Let's try some examples using different signs and see how they work:
print(3*3+3/3-3)  #This will output 7
#In this example, multiplication is done first because it has higher priority than addition.
#Then division is performed next since it has higher priority than subtraction.
#Finally, subtraction is performed last due to its lowest priority.

print (3 *(3+3)/3-3)   #This will also output will be 3, We have same digit but  with different arrangement so it gives us different result.
#We can also use parentheses to change the order
